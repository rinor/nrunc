# nrunc: Experimental Testing Playground

Welcome to the **nrunc** repository! This project serves as an **experimental testing playground** for exploring and validating features related to [nanos](https://github.com/nanovms/nanos) and [urunc](https://github.com/nubificus/urunc) integration. Our goal is to experiment with various functionalities, test APIs, and gather insights.

## Purpose
The findings and results from our experiments will be pushed to the upstream repository [urunc](https://github.com/nubificus/urunc) once the APIs are finalized. This ensures that our contributions are integrated into the main project, benefiting the broader community.
